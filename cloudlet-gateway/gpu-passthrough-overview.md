# GPU Passthrough Setup and Performance

Many edge workloads require a GPU to meet latency requirements. However, sharing
and virtualizing GPU devices for computation remain a challenge. In below, I
will describe our group's setup to allow multi-tenancy on GPUs.

## Architecture

The figure below represents the architecture. We adopt a containers on top of
virtual machines approach to allow GPU sharing. The GPU device is dedicated to a
particular VM through GPU-passthrough on the host.
